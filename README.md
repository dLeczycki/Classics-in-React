# How to run

Each project is JavaScript application created with 'Create React App'. To run an application you need to go into specified directory in terminal, install node_modules (ignored by .gitignore file) with:

```
npm install
```

At last you can easily run application with:

```
npm run
```

Application should run on localhost:3000.
